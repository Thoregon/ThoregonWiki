The Great Purge
===============

due to the fact, that the thoregon system is very slow, during startup as well as in operation, we decided
to do a great purge, refactoring and rebuild.

to start, first we need orientation where the performance sinks are.

## Performance Measurements

provide measuring points:
- loaders
- decorators (proxies)
- start procedure

cleanup 
- boot proc
- imports -> import not whole module (index.mjs) but the module containing the required objects (classes and functions)



## Universe

### letThereBeLight

get rid of all superfluous services

### Proxies

## System events

reliability of system events is essential
!! identity 'auth' !!

## Persistence
